<p id="description">Picturest is a photo-based social media web application that was developed by three aspiring web developers. We were inspired to build this project because social media applications are a big part of everyone’s daily lives and sharing photos and other forms of media make up a big part of social media websites and how we connect with the world and share information.</p>
